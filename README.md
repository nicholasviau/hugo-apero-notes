Notes for editing and setting up a Hugo Apero website in R.


## Sections

Blog, projects, and other pages are called sections. Ap√©ro provides unique layouts for three main content sections:

* blogs
* projects
* talks

### Renaming Sections

What happens if we need to rename a section? For example, if we were edting the Blog section

## Collections


This is a tricky area to navigate.

* Right now, use the `/collection/*/` format, where `/*/` is a section page. In that section apge, change the layout to `list-sidebar` to display a list of the entries as the landing page.
* Retain `layout: single-series` in the meta data if you want to create a unique landing page.
